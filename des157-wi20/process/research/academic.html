                <h2>American Philanthropy</h2>
                <p>As of 2018, more Americans have been reported volunteering than ever before in history. Research published on nationalservice.gov shows that people are doing more than just volunteering, “Volunteers donate to charity at twice the rate as non-volunteers. Nearly 80 percent of volunteers donated to charity, compared to 40 percent of non-volunteers”. CNCS conducted research on volunteering in America in order to shed light on the impact that American volunteers have. The goal of the research was to help people who make donations understand how their contributions are connected to other donors and recipients (“Volunteering in the U.S…”)
                </p>
                <p>Another article, published on theconversation.com, discusses more research regarding American donor habits. The article states that fewer Americans are donating money, however, the total value of donations is higher than ever. According to the 2018 Giving USA report, Americans gave a total of $410 billion to charity in 2018. The average amount donated in the U.S. rose from less than $2,000 in 2002 to more than $2,500 in 2014 in current dollars. One hypothesis for the decrease of donors is the decline in the middle class. Less people can afford to make charitable donations, therefore, only people who make over a certain amount per year are contributing to charities (Osili).

                <p>Since 1968, the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy’s Philanthropy Panel Study (PPS), has tracked and observed the philanthropic behaviors of American families. PPS is America’s first and only ongoing study of philanthropic behavior. Researchers aim to gain information about patterns in philanthropy in order to inspire and improve the act of giving. Their goal is similar to that of the researchers who published their findings on nationalservice.org; encourage current and future donors, and create a sense of connectivity between donors and recipients (“Philanthropy Panel Study”).
                </p>
                <p>The giving statistics on Charitynavigator.org shows how much money Americans give to charity, who the donors are and where the money goes. The information is organized into three different sections, making it easy to clearly see who the givers and receivers are, and what is being donated. The site shows that education is the number one recipient of American donations, followed by various human services and organizations for the environment and animals, and finally, religious organizations. Research shows that the majority of the donations are made by individuals. Other givers include corporations and foundations (“Giving Statistics”). 
                </p>
                <p>All of the articles and research studies presented share the same goal of learning more about American donors. The articles and studies also explore which Americans have donated to charity throughout history. Some even look at how much money has been donated to charity over time. Overall, these articles help people understand how important donations are to not only the recipients but society as well.
