                <h2>Strengths</h2>
   <p>The interface that I will be creating will help increase empathy among people all over the world. It will also hopefully increase donations to positive causes. Another strength that my project has is that it will be a visual representation of how donations travel and are used. There are not currently any platforms that provide this information to the public. Many organizations will have a counter on their website that keeps track of donation numbers and whatnot, but none of them have any kind of interactive visual representation.

                  <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
             <p>Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have my own philanthropic organization to draw data form, so I have to find data from a pre existing organization. I am currently searching for data I can use, however, that information can be quite hard to find. Also, moving forward, I will have to either get organizations to adopt my design, or create a seperate platform that people can use as an extension of the organization site that they donated to.</p>

                <h2>Opportunities</h2>
           <p>My project will appeal to many people, especially because, with the rise in technology, people will often just make a donation online, or send money to a cause, rather than actually volunteering in a hands-on way. My design will help people feel involved and make a difference without leaving their homes.

                <h2>Threats</h2>
        <p>Some organizations may be hesitant to share their data. Some donors may also prefer to stay anonymous. I would need to get permission from both the company and the donors in order to share their information. In addition, the organization may be hesitant to use their resources in order to update the platform in real time. I will need to consider these restrictions when moving forward with my project development.
