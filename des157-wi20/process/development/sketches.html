                <p>I want to create an interactive platform that helps people see how their donations make a difference in the lives of the recipients. I sketched out how that might look. I will get data from an organization and then focus on a single donor. The donor will have their own profile where they can see donations and a web that displays what happens to it over time. The site will be updated everytime a change is made. This platform will hopefully encourage donors to keep contributing, and inspire new people to begin. </p>

                <p> Another feature of this design could potentially be a larger web that connects each donor with one eachother. This web could also connect the donor with each of their donations, if they have made more than one. this web will enhance a sense of connectivity between donors.</p>
