                <h2>About the Site</h2>
                <p>I want to create an interactive platform that helps people see how their donations make a difference in the lives of the recipients. I sketched out how that might look. I will get data from an organization and then focus on a single donor. The donor will have their own profile where they can see donations and a web that displays what happens to it over time. The site will be updated everytime a change is made. This platform will hopefully encourage donors to keep contributing, and inspire new people to begin. </p>
                <h2>Home Page</h2>

                <p>One the home page, the user will have the option to view their donations, make a donation, see current events, and more. If the the viewer clicks on one of their donations they will be able to track it, as shown below.</p>

                <h2>Donate</h2>
                <p>Another aspect of this website is to allow people to make additional donations. On the homepage there will be a button that says "Donate", if the user clicks on it then they will be taken to a donation page where they can select the recipient of their donation, the type of donation that they would like to make, and how much they want to donate (seen below).</p>
